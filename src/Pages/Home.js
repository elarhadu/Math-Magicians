        Calculators have not only greatly enhanced our ability to perform the
        regular computations that are involved in everyday life, but provided
        humans with the ability to understand mathematics on a greater scale
        than ever imagined. Calculations which were previously cumbersome and
        time-consuming can now be done in minutes or even seconds, all at the
        push of a few buttons. Without calculators, advanced math courses, such
        as Calculus, would require much longer class-times and reformatted
        lesson plans. Calculators, when used alongside a comprehensive
        mathematics curriculum, increase the quality and quantity of student
        learning
